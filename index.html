<p>When I first saw a monoid, my eyes glazed over the details in the midst of haskell concept overload. <code>mempty</code> was something that was empty I guessed, and m seemed to be a universal prefix shoved randomly throughout the haskell codebase. And <code>mappend</code>, well that must be how you append lists I guess, maybe in a monad thing. And <code>&lt;&gt;</code> - I just saw anything wrapped in greater than less than signs as one ofthose things I'd have to look up later.</p>
<p>It took a year before I realised that mappend was just like adding up numbers, and mempty was just like 0. In slightly shorter time, I discovered that &lt;&gt; was just like + - except you couldn't say that.</p>
<p>So, enough with the baby words and line noise, let's call them + and zero (and map!).</p>
<p>This is a numeric tower built with:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>boiler-plate category theory</li>
<li>the subhask numeric tower, stripped of mutability and sub-category concepts.</li>
<li>Semigroups operator as '+'</li>
<li>Monoid operator as zero</li>
<li>Protolude as a reference point for fitting in with the rest of the haskell ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
